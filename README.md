# üöó Arduino Bluetooth Car

**Arduino Bluetooth Car** is an **open-source** project that guides you through building a **Bluetooth-controlled car** using **Arduino**. It includes everything from **3D-printable** **STL files** and **wiring diagrams** to **Arduino code** and a **mobile app**, making it a comprehensive solution for electronics and embedded systems development.

* Includes **STL** files for **3D-printing** the **car** components.
* Fully functional **Arduino** **code** to **control motors** and **Bluetooth** communication.
* Detailed **circuit** **diagrams** for easy and accurate assembly.
* Custom **Android** **app** for real-time car **control via Bluetooth**.
* Ideal for students, makers, and **robotics** enthusiasts.

Gain practical experience with a fully functional prototype!

## üõ†Ô∏è Assembly Guide

> Follow these steps to build your Car from scratch

1. **Gather the Components**
  - Arduino Nano
  - Bluetooth module HC-05 TTL
  - Double H bridge driver L298N
  - 4x TT motors with gearbox
  - 2x GeB LiPol Baterie 3.7V
  - Breadboard 830 points
  - Dupont Wires (M-M, F-F, M-F)

<br>

2. **Print and Assemble the Car Body**

  <div align="left">
    <img src="imgs/blender.png" width="320px" alt="Blender Environment Preview">
  </div>

  - All `.stl` files are ready for printing and are located in the [`3d-models/`](3d-models/) folder.
  - You will need to print [`nail.stl`](3d-models/nail.stl) **8 times** and [`wheel.stl`](3d-models/wheel.stl) **4 times**.
  - To help visualize the complete car, refer to the included Blender file: [`arduino-BTcar.blend`](3d-models/arduino-BTcar.blend).
  - Open this `.blend` file in [Blender](https://www.blender.org) to view the correct orientation and placement of all printed components.

<br>

3. **Assemble the Electronics**

  <div align="left">
    <img src="circuit/circuit.png" width="320px" alt="Wiring Diagram">
  </div>

  - Refer to the wiring diagram [`circuit.png`](circuit/circuit.png) for a clear view of the complete setup.
  - Ensure all **power supply** connections are secure and correct to avoid hardware damage.
  - You can also explore the circuit in an editable format by opening the [`circuit.ckt`](circuit/circuit.ckt) file.
  - Open this `.ckt` file in [Cirkit Designer IDE](https://app.cirkitdesigner.com/project) or any compatible circuit design software.

<br>

4. **Upload the Code**
  - Connect the **Arduino Nano** to your computer using a **Mini-B USB** cable.
  - Open [`code.ino`](code.ino) in the [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software)
  - Select **Arduino Nano** and correct **COM port**
  - Click **Upload**

<br>

5. **Install the App**
  - Download the `controller.apk` from the repo root or click [here](controller.apk).
  - Install it on your Android device (you may need to allow unknown sources).
  - Enable Bluetooth and connect to **HC-05**. The default pairing password is `1234`.
  - Open the app, tap **Connect**, and choose **HC-05**. Wait until the **Connect** button becomes dark ‚Äî this indicates a successful connection.
